WordPress-LessonPlans 
==================

The WordPress Training Lesson Plan Guide by WPStudio is organized as a series of twenty topical lessons which can be modified for a 15 week university course lesson plan, a K-12 course setting, or other training environments. Each lesson includes objectives, lecture teaching points, assigned readings, tutorial videos, hands-on practice activities, and additional resources. Several options for student web design projects and evaluation rubrics are also included. Many hands-on activities for students involve writing a blog post and following accompanying rubric.  We recommend you setup a class WordPress blog which students can use to post and share reflection assignments.

The 20 sessions presented in this guide are organized into 6 modules:

1. Web Fundamentals
2. WordPress Foundations
3. Media
4. Customization
5. Maintenance and Upgrades
6. Presentation

Each topical lesson includes:

1. Objectives
2. Lecture Teaching Points
3. Assigned Readings - Web-based articles & eBooks (PDF)
4. Tutorial Videos
5. Hands-on Practice
6. Additional Resources
